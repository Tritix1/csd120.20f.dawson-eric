            <h1> Welcome to Eric's CSD120 Website! </h1>
                <p> My name is Eric. I am <strong><em> very </em></strong> excited for this course and excited to learn about web design and coding in general. I have done a little bit of work in coding myself but nothing that is very complicated. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/MMjzbnq" title="imgur" target="_blank">Here is a link </a> to the most complicated script I have written up (prior to this course). It is 2 different scripts with slightly different purposes, as you will see. It took me a few days of messing around to get it to work right although it was probably only a few hours of work total.</p>

                <p> I am also a <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/vfZNu" title="imgur"> huge metal fan.</a> Jokes aside, I enjoy listening to metal music the most but sometimes get a craving for rock or even bassy techno-dubstep type music. I have been to the Montebello Rockfest twice, once in 2017 and once in 2018. Some of my favourite bands were playing there including Blind Witness, Lamb of God and All That Remains.</p>
